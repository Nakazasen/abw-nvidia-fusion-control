# Current Blockers (As of 2026-05-17)

## Ownership

- Owner: Auditor + Governance Recorder
- Role: Active blocker dashboard for current local state

## SOURCE OF TRUTH

- Canonical persistent risks: `05_DECISIONS/RISKS.md`
- Canonical latest accepted operational context: `03_OPERATIONS/HANDOFF.md`

## DO NOT DUPLICATE

- Do not restate full historical evidence reports here.
- Keep blockers date-scoped and operationally actionable.

## Blockers Closed (Preserved Truth)

- Previous manual path blocker `MANUAL_PATH_REVALIDATION_V3_FAIL` is closed by accepted `MANUAL_PATH_REVALIDATION_V3_PASS`.
- Deterministic local-file workflow blocker for bounded path is interpreted as closed.

## Active Blockers / Gating Constraints

1. Readiness promotion blocker
- No evidence supports promotion beyond `BOUNDED_DAILY_USE_CANDIDATE_LOCAL_FILE_WORKFLOWS`.
- `DAILY_USE_READY` and production claims remain blocked.

2. Real-data validation blocker
- Existing accepted passes are bounded to synthetic/sanitized workflows.
- Broad private/work-document readiness remains blocked.

3. Bridge scope blocker
- Full bridge capabilities (write-back/sync/auto-promote/execute-command through ABW path) remain blocked by governance boundaries.

4. UI smoke residual warning blocker
- Browser smoke still carries a recurring non-blocking warning around inline edit widget observability.
- This remains a residual confidence gap for UX completeness claims.

5. Local NVIDIA dirty-state blocker for governance recording
- NVIDIA repo has uncommitted local changes in core UI/server/tests/docs files.
- Until committed/audited, this state is sprint-in-progress evidence, not accepted governance truth.

## Immediate Risk If Ignored

- Overclaim risk rises if uncommitted NVIDIA UX work is treated as finalized readiness.
- Cross-file governance drift risk rises if updated local sprint state is not explicitly audited and recorded.
